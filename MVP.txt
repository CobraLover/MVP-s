Django E-commerce Project - ShopMaster: Challenges and Progress Report

Challenges
What unexpected challenges have surfaced during your project?
During the implementation phase, several unexpected challenges emerged that were not evident during the research phase:

Robust Security Measures: Ensuring robust security was a significant hurdle. Our initial research covered broad security concepts, but the practical application revealed many intricate issues. For example, securing authentication processes and mitigating vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) required more advanced strategies and a deeper understanding than initially anticipated.

Payment Gateway Integration: Integrating payment gateways and achieving PCI DSS compliance brought about unexpected complexities. The process was more intricate than expected, involving stringent security protocols and thorough testing to ensure compliance.

How have you adapted your plan to address these challenges?
To address these challenges, I revised our project plan to incorporate more stringent security protocols:

Enhanced Security Measures: We used libraries like bcrypt for password hashing and jsonwebtoken for secure user sessions. We also scheduled regular security audits and integrated penetration testing into our development cycle.

Payment Gateway Compliance: More time was allocated to ensure that the payment gateway integration met PCI DSS standards, allowing for thorough testing and compliance checks.

Additional Tools: Using libraries like django-validator for input validation and employing comprehensive security frameworks helped us strengthen our application's defenses.

What unexpected non-technical challenges have you faced?
On the non-technical side, several unexpected challenges surfaced:

Communication and Coordination: Coordinating with third-party service providers such as Render.com and Clever Cloud led to delays. Resolving issues and obtaining support often took longer than anticipated.

Stakeholder Engagement: Aligning the project’s scope and timeline with changing business requirements required continuous engagement with stakeholders. This added complexity to project management and necessitated frequent adjustments to our plan.

Collaboration
Discuss any help you’ve received or provided from/to peers, staff, mentors, etc.
Although I wasn’t working within a formal team, I received significant support from peers and mentors:

Peer Code Reviews: Peer code reviews were instrumental in identifying potential issues early, thereby enhancing code quality.

Mentor Guidance: Mentors provided invaluable guidance on architectural decisions and optimizing database performance.

Community Support: Engaging with developer forums and community groups offered fresh perspectives and troubleshooting assistance, which was crucial for overcoming specific technical challenges.

Progress
On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate the progress you’ve made this week?
I would rate the progress this week as an 8 out of 10.

How are you measuring your progress?
Task Implementation: Tracking the completion of tasks and milestones using a project management tool.
Code Quality: Conducting regular peer reviews.
Debugging: Monitoring the number of bugs identified and resolved.
Documentation: Keeping project documentation updated and comprehensive.
Discuss why you have given yourself this rating
This rating reflects the successful implementation and testing of key features such as user authentication, product management, and order processing. However, unforeseen security challenges and integration complexities caused some delays. Despite these obstacles, my dedication to the project has kept it on track, warranting a positive but imperfect rating.
